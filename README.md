## Job Analysis Application

The `Job Analysis` app is a single-page app to provide insights about the dataset provided by [vega-datasets](https://github.com/vega/vega-datasets/blob/master/data/jobs.json). The dataset has information about 255 unique jobs and distribution of genders to those jobs over the years. The main (landing) page of the app shows general information about job market change over the year and some information about the dataset in general, like the total number of data and unique jobs for years.

In the second part, users will be able to see the change of gender dominancy information over the years. Moreover, users can enable/disable these groups by clicking checkboxes next to the graph. This will allow users to easily compare/contrast different groups.

In the third part, the app will show the top 10 jobs for the men and the women in the bar chart. By clicking on a bar, users will be able to see historical changes for the selected job over the years. This will provide users to understand if current top jobs have been amongst the top or they have just emerged some point in time.

In the last section, users will be able to select a specific job from the dropdown menu and the line chart next to the dropdown menu will be updated automatically. Different color codes for male employees and women employees will make it easier to compare employee existence over the years.

Sketch below shows how main page will look like.
