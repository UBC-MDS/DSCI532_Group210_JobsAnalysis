## Reflection

### What went well?

- We communicated well as a team in terms of keeping each other in the loop of what each other was working on and the overall progress of the development. Everyone felt like they are a part of the team.

- We were able to make the charts according to our original plan. Dash callbacks and Altair interaction features allowed us to create interactive graphs based on our vision. The end product feels complete.

- With active and consensus-driven cooperation, each team member was able to do what they wanted and not get assigned to uninteresting tasks to ensure that the project was fun and enjoyable for everyone.

- Our final product does an excellent job of allowing users to look at the gender balance trends from different angles. They can investigate a single job's gender proportion, compare job gender dominant groups' popularities, and explore the female employment numbers for the top 10 positions in some of those groups. Basically, the application allows a variety of ways to gain insights on how the gender balance has been changing, and hence enable users to ask better questions on how to improve gender ratios in some industries.

### Limitations

- We still had limited knowledge about the full extent of Dash's and Altair's capability for interactive graphs. We could not rule out the possibilities of more efficacious graphs that allow users to drill down to more valuable insights.    

- The user experience was not exactly optimal because we all lacked the expertise of application design. Our dashboard interface could be more aesthetically pleasing, more fun to spend time on, and more intuitive to use if we had more UX and UI expertise on the team.

- We were not able to identify the source of the data and get more background information on it. We do not know whether the data was for a country or several countries. We do not know how the data was collected either. Having this information would be to help design the charts.

### Future improvements

- There are lots of room for improvement in making the app more aesthetically pleasing and more intuitive in terms of user experience. For instance, the charts can probably be laid out better to allow users to compare them. The text elements can be reorganized so that they convey the relevance of the information better. The input elements can take up less space so that they are more obstructive to the entire experience but serve their functions at the same time.

- We can group the jobs into industries and develop more useful charts regarding the gender balance in different sectors. Users who are looking for insights about the historical trends of industry gender ratios would undoubtedly appreciate these additional charts.

### Addressed issues

We solved a bunch of issues for this milestone. We addressed the duplicated text in the README file by removing it. We picked a mechanic as a team on how to choose the top 10 jobs in terms of gender balance. Our axes were made not to change anymore after our TA gave us feedback. We made the menu panel more clear and added more information about the data based on the TA's feedback. Also, we added more information about the source of the data and how the gender balance groups were derived to address that ambiguity raised by the TA.

### Wishlist features/bug-fixes

Again, we mainly wish that we could group the jobs into industries and make a chart allowing the users to investigate the gender balance trends of different industries. We believe this chart will make the application more valuable to users because many of them may use the dashboard to look for industry insights in terms of historical gender employment trends and may find going through individual jobs to infer industry information too troublesomely.

### Changes we have made for milestone 3

For project maintenance, we listened to much feedback and pushed a bunch of small fixes, which mainly made the application more user-friendly. We implemented bootstrap styles to make the app layout more standard and intuitive. We also added a description and a divider before each chart for a more precise presentation. We decided against tweaking the team contract because we have worked well together as a team so far. In terms of UI changes, we rotated the x-axes on some charts and added tooltips to the bars so that it is easier on the eyes and more informative on the brain. We also refactored the code a bit so that the components were assigned to different variables as opposed to being all written out in one single variable. A list of changes we made could be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_Group210_JobsAnalysis/issues/36). In summary, we improved the texts, layouts, user interface components of the app, and the code.

### Feedback summary

Overall, we received only minor feedback on the visual of the application, a few of its less-than-intuitive UI components, and some of the confusing texts. There were quite a few complaints on the layouts and the texts being confusing, so we decided to implement the bootstrap layouts, re-write, and change the placement of the texts. There was also some feedback regarding tweaks of the graphs' functionalities, but we do not entirely agree on whether they are helpful. For instance, one feedback suggested we filled the zero job numbers with some reasonable names in some years. Still, we decided against making that judgment because of a lack of information on whether that would be more reflective of reality. We put fewer priorities on extra features and more on UI issues because we want to make sure the current product is reliable first. The feedback session was quite useful in terms of seeing our app from users' perspectives and understanding what was confusing. Still, we are pleased that our app, after the improvements, is user-friendly and offers values while being clean.
