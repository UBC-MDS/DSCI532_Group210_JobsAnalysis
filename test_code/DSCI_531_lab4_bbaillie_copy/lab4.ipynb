    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will be choosing a dataset to do some exploratory data analysis. Your goal is to produce a readable, runnable jupyter notebook that takes your audience through the various stages of exploratory data analysis from initially loading the data, to any wrangling or cleaning needed, and finally visualizing trends in the data to help answer the research questions. The purpose of this lab is for you to practice EDA with visualizations and a little bit of wrangling. Its purpose is NOT for you to spend a tonne of time cleaning your data. The sample datsets provided require minimal cleaning. If you choose your own dataset, please ensure you avoid datasets that require too much cleaning. No matter which dataset you choose, there will likely be some wrangling involved. To help you with exploring the data, coming up with good research questions, and any wrangling, the DSCI 531 teaching team has scheduled additional office hours this week to help you. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In addition, Tom has very kindly agreed to open up the instructor and TAs office hours for DSCI 523 for you to get additional help with wrangling.** Though we will not be explicitly assessing wrangling in 531, I encourage you to use our office hours to help you explore the dataset you choose! Note: wrangling can be done in either R or python (if in R, save the wrangled data to disk and read it in) but the plots in this lab must be done in Altair. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **The final version of Lab 4 needs to be submitted by the usual weekly deadline (Saturday November 9th at 6PM)**\n",
    "- **Your peer-review is due at a special time, on Tuesday November 12th at 11:59 PM.**\n",

    "## Lab 4 Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop an exploratory data analysis plan with an unfamiliar dataset\n",
    "- Apply effective design principles to visual representations of data\n",
    "- Use the `Altair` library in `python` to generate visual representations of data for several plot types\n",
    "\n",
    "## How will I be graded?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The MDS rubrics can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/tree/master/rubric). \n",
    "- Solutions to the practice problems are provided in the students repo for the course\n",
    "- Each question below is assigned points assigned to MDS rubrics \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall submission\n",
    "rubric={mechanics:5, writing: 18}\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please make sure you check your spelling, grammar, punctuation, and ensure that your writing has good logical structure and flow\n",
    "- To submit this assignment, submit this jupyter notebook with your answers embedded in the appropriate cells.\n",
    "- Update your README file with the questions and links to your submission.\n",
    "- Follow the general [lab instructions](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/general_lab_instructions/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-lab\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think a bit about which dataset you would like to use for lab 4. The lab will be your opportunity to get feedback from TAs about your ideas on how to explore the dataset you chose. In this lab, you will also be able to use your own data set to do some exploratory data analysis"

All the questions above do not need to be answered, it's more to guide your exploration and think a little bit about the context of your data. It is also possible you will not know the answers to some of the questions above, that is FINE - data scientists are often faced with the challenge of analyzing data from unknown sources. Do your best, acknowledge the limitations of your data as well as your understanding of it. Also, make it clear what you're speculating about. For example, \"I speculate that the {...column_name...} column must be related to {....} because {....}.\"*"

That being said, you should aim for 2-3 high quality effective visualizations (and no more than 4). A faceted plot counts as one visualization. If you cannot come up with 2 effective visualizations, perhaps you need to re-think your research questions (or add more). If you need more than 4, perhaps it's a sign that your research question is too broad. Use your judgment, and understand that we will mark this section as a whole on quality rather than quantity. It is better to have fewer truly effective plots that directly address the research question, than pages and pages of plots that are hard to interpret. You will be evaluated on both your visualization itself (viz rubric) and your justification for selecting it (reasoning rubric).*\n",

    "According to my findings, the three jobs I chose to represent historically female jobs were more male dominated or balanced in the 1850's, which makes sense as to my knowledge it was less common for women to work at all at the time. That being said, the data from then on did show the disparity I had presumed. The divide between men and women in teaching jobs was not as drastic as I had presumed, but still favoured women. No drastic change in balance was noticed for either Teachers or Nurses, but proportions of male Household workes did increase in the 2000's. As for historically male jobs, Plumbing has remained completely male dominated over the past 150 years, while the proportion of women in Lawyer/Judge jobs has seen a steep increase starting in the 1970's, reaching 30% in 2000 and trending towards overtaking men. The findings on the Professor job surprised me as it is not as historically male dominated as I had assumed it would be. While it was male dominated before the 1900's, besides from a peak of women in the field in 1860, women have been steadily closing the gap with a near perfectly balanced split as of 2000. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while the historically female job of teacher, nurse, and household worker, and the historically male job of plumber, have not seen an increase in male or female workers respectively to balance the divide in the last 150 years, the historically male jobs of Lawyer/Judge and Professor have reached nearly perfectly balanced since 2000. To me this is indicative of women's fight for representation, and the spread of toxic masculinity and damaging ideas like those that \"womens jobs\" are of less value than \"mens jobs\"."

    "- Work on your branch, and once you're done send a PR to my fork. \n",

    "- We'll then review it and give you feedback, or make minor changes ourselves and then submit it to the main Altair repo (crediting you as the original author)\n",
    "- It's preferred to use one of the vega datasets as they're open and easily accessible\n",
    "- There are four levels of contributions and they're awarded points based on amount of effort:\n",
    "    - Extreme effort (e.g.: Multiple plot examples, case studies, or major improvements with documentation - 15 points)\n",
    "    - High effort (e.g.: Complex plot examples, case study, or documentation improvements - 10 points)\n",
    "    - Moderate effort (e.g.: A plot example, or minor improvements to documentation - 5 points)\n",

    "    - contain a category tag (possible options: Simple Charts, Bar Charts, Line Charts, Area Charts, Scatter Plots, Histograms, Interactive Charts, Case Studies, Other Charts)\n",
    "    - define a chart variable with the main chart object (This will be used both in the unit tests to confirm that the example executes properly, and also eventually used to display the visualization on the documentation website).\n",
