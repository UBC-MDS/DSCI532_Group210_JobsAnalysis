### Motivation and Purpose

### Description of the data

In this project we will be visualizing the gender makeup of job workforces from 255 different jobs between the years 1850 and 2000. Each of the 7650 workforces in our data have 5 associated variables that describe their job (`job`), the binary gender of the workforce (`sex`), the decade their information was collected (`year`), and the proportion of their workforce to that of the decade's total workforce (`perc`). Using this data we will also derive a two new variables for each workforce, the first being the dominant gender group (`gender_dominant_group`) of their jobs total workforce in that decade (only male, male dominant, balanced, female dominant, only female), and the second being the proportion of their workforce to the total workforce of that job in that decade.
