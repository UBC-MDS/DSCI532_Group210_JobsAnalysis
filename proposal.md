### Motivation and Purpose

### Description of the data

In this project, we will be visualizing the gender makeup of job workforces from 255 different jobs between the years 1850 and 2000. Each of the 7650 workforces in our data have 5 associated variables that describe their job name (`job`), the binary sex of the workforce (`sex`), the decade their information was collected (`year`), and the proportion of the workforce to that of the decade's total workforce (`perc`). Using this data, we will also derive two new variables for each workforce. The first is the dominant sex of that workforce's job in that decade (`gender_dominant_group`), and it is based on the ratio of men to women in that job in that decade (only male, male dominant, balanced, female dominant, only female). The second is the proportion of the workforce to that of their job's total workforce in that decade (`annual_gender_prop_in_job`).
