### Motivation and Purpose

Diversity has been shown consistently by research to be conducive to increased innovation, productivity, and employee engagement in a company. It brings more perspectives, thereby enabling teams to make more thorough and creative decisions. Furthermore, it upgrades a company's reputation, allowing it to connect with the community on a deeper level.

For many industries, the most critical benchmark for achieving diversity is through gender. Historically, different jobs have had various degrees of gender balance, and they are still evolving today. Despite this progress, there are still a lot more male-dominated occupations than balanced or female-dominated groups. Therefore, there are still lots of room for improvement. For researchers or any other stakeholders looking to improve gender balance in specific industries, it is essential to explore and compare the historical trends on gender balance in relevant jobs in order to find insights on obstacles, identify good and bad examples on gender balance, and get guidance on directing future research efforts.

We propose building an application that makes this exploration possible. In particular, this web application will provide dashboards that portray historical trends of different job gender groups, such as male-dominated, female-dominated, or male-only jobs, and how specific jobs' gender proportions have evolved. Users will be able to see the general trends and track their progress as well as look more deeply into the jobs they are interested in and see how their gender balances have changed. They will be able to identify problems, draw comparisons, and find valuable clues that inform them further on how to improve gender balance in specific industries.
